# OpenGLES
Android application running openGL ES 2 in an activity.
## Goals
* Iterate on working application and slowly extract and encapsulate all of the grapics rendering behind agnostic interfaces (i.e., to enable swapping between openGL, Vulkan, Metal or whatever)
* Have a lightweight, fun app to keep up-to-date on Java and on graphics programming
